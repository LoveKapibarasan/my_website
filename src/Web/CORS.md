# CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)  
a security mechanism in web browsers.

### Background

* Web browsers enforce a rule called the **Same-Origin Policy**.

* Origin = scheme (http/https) + domain + port.

* Because of this policy, JavaScript running on one origin (say, Origin A) cannot freely access resources from another origin (Origin B). This is essential for security.
