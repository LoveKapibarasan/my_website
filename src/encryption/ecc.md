Alright, let’s go through the **mathematical explanation of ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography)** in English.

## an elliptic curve?

In ECC, an elliptic curve is defined by an equation of the form:

$$
y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
$$

with the condition that $4a^3 + 27b^2 \neq 0$ (to avoid singularities like cusps or self-intersections).

Graphically, this looks like an "∞" shape, but for cryptography we use points **over a finite field**, not real numbers.

## Elliptic curve over a finite field

Instead of real numbers, ECC works modulo a prime $p$. The set of valid points is:

$$
E(\mathbb{F}_p) = \{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{F}_p^2 \mid y^2 \equiv x^3 + ax + b \ (\text{mod } p) \} \cup \{\mathcal{O}\}
$$

* $\mathcal{O}$ is a special point at infinity, which acts as the identity element of the group.

## Group law: point addition

The core of ECC is defining addition of points on the curve.

* Given two points $P$ and $Q$, draw the line through them.
* Find the third intersection point of this line with the curve.
* Reflect that point across the x-axis → that is defined as the sum $R = P + Q$.

If $P = Q$, the tangent line at $P$ is used instead, which defines point doubling $2P$.

With these rules, the set of points forms an **abelian group**.

## Cryptographic use

* Choose a base point $P$ (generator).
* Pick a random secret integer $k$ (private key).
* Compute the public key as $Q = kP$ (repeated addition of $P$).

The security relies on the **Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)**:

* Given $P$ and $Q = kP$, it is computationally infeasible to recover $k$.

This is analogous to the hardness of prime factorization in RSA.

## 5. Curve25519

A specific, modern elliptic curve:

$$
y^2 = x^3 + 486662x^2 + x \quad \text{over } \mathbb{F}_{2^{255} - 19}
$$

* Uses the prime field $p = 2^{255} - 19$.
