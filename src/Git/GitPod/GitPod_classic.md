# GitHub Pod Manual

This manual provides guidance on using GitHub Pods, which are integrations or encapsulations for modular functionality in GitHub-related workflows. (Note: If you are referring to CocoaPods or Kubernetes Pods in conjunction with GitHub, please clarify.)

---

## 1. Introduction

GitHub Pods are not a native GitHub feature but can refer to a modular plugin or service used with GitHub Actions, GitHub Apps, or other CI/CD integrations. This manual assumes the term "Pod" refers to such modular components for automating GitHub workflows.

---

## 2. Setup

### 2.1 Prerequisites

* GitHub account
* Repository access (read/write)
* Node.js and npm or Docker (depending on the Pod type)
* Git installed

### 2.2 Installing a Pod

Depending on the Pod type:

**For GitHub Actions Pods:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy Pod

on: [push]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: your-org/deploy-pod@v1
        with:
          api-key: “${{ secrets.API_KEY }}”
```

**For npm-based Pods:**

```bash
npm install @your-org/github-pod
```

**For Docker Pods:**

```bash
docker pull yourorg/github-pod:latest
docker run yourorg/github-pod
```

---

## 3. Configuration

Each Pod may include a config file, often `.podrc` or a YAML/JSON configuration in the repository.

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "deploy-bot",
  "branch": "main",
  "environments": ["staging", "production"]
}
```

---

## 4. Usage

### 4.1 Running a Pod

* GitHub Actions Pods run on GitHub-triggered events.
* Local Pods (npm or Docker) are run manually or via CI/CD pipelines.

### 4.2 Debugging

Check logs:

* GitHub Actions > Actions tab > Specific workflow run
* Local Docker logs or npm script output

---

## 5. Creating Your Own GitHub Pod

### 5.1 GitHub Action Pod

```yaml
# action.yml
name: 'My GitHub Pod'
description: 'Performs automated task'
inputs:
  token:
    required: true
    description: 'GitHub Token'
runs:
  using: 'node12'
  main: 'dist/index.js'
```

### 5.2 JavaScript Implementation

```js
// index.js
const core = require('@actions/core');
const github = require('@actions/github');

(async () => {
  const token = core.getInput('token');
  const octokit = github.getOctokit(token);
  // ... your logic here
})();
```

---

## 6. Best Practices

* Use encrypted secrets for credentials
* Keep Pods modular and reusable
* Version your Pods (e.g., `v1`, `v2`)
* Document Pod inputs/outputs clearly

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Issue                        | Solution                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pod not triggered            | Check `.github/workflows` file syntax and event type    |
| Environment variable missing | Verify repository secrets are set                       |
| Dependency errors            | Ensure correct Node.js/npm version or Docker base image |

## 9. Glossary

* **Pod**: A modular integration unit used in automation workflows
* **GitHub Action**: A custom workflow step
* **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
* **Secrets**: Encrypted values stored in GitHub repositories
