## What is a socket?

* A CPU has a fixed shape for its "pins" or "contacts," and it can only be inserted into a motherboard socket that matches.

That’s why the CPU generation and the motherboard generation must match; otherwise, they won’t physically work together.

**AM4**

Released: Mainstream from around 2017 to 2022

Supported CPUs: Ryzen 1000–5000 series (Zen 1 to Zen 3)

Memory: DDR4

Examples: Ryzen 5 5600X, Ryzen 7 5700G, Ryzen 7 5800X


**AM5**

Released: From 2022 to present (latest socket)

Supported CPUs: Ryzen 7000 series and later (Zen 4 to Zen 5, e.g., Ryzen 5 7600, 8400F, 8700G, etc.)

Memory: DDR5 only


* If the CPU has pins on the bottom, it’s AM4.
* If the CPU has flat gold pads instead, it’s AM5


## BOX Version

* Retail package (boxed)

* Longer manufacturer warranty (for AMD: usually 3 years)

* Some models include a retail cooler (stock fan)

* Comes with a manual, stickers, and other extras

## Tray / Bulk Version

* Form used for large-scale shipments by the manufacturer
→ Called “Tray” because CPUs are shipped in bulk, lined up in trays for OEMs and shops

* Shorter warranty / often shop warranty only (about 6–12 months)

* No cooler or box included — only the CPU itself

* Therefore, slightly cheaper in price
