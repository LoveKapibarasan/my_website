## SSD Sizes (Form Factors)

1. 2.5-inch SATA SSD

* Connects with cables like an HDD (SATA data cable + power cable)

* Maximum speed is about 560 MB/s (SATA III theoretical limit)

* Best suited for older PCs or as secondary storage

2. M.2 SSD

* Card-type drive that plugs directly into the motherboard (looks like a stick of gum)

* Size is specified as “width 22mm × length xxmm”

* 2280 (22×80mm) is the most common

* 2242, 2260, 22110 also exist.


### Add-in Card (AIC SSD)

* Installed in a PCIe slot like a graphics card

* Mainly used in high-performance servers or for ultra-fast storage; not very common in custom PCs

## Key Metrics (Things to Compare in Specs)

* Sequential Speed
    * Measured in MB/s
    * High-end PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSDs can reach around 7,000 MB/s

* Random Access Performance (IOPS)

    * 4K Random Read/Write performance

    * Strongly affects the “snappiness” of games and OS boot times

* Endurance

    * TBW (Total Bytes Written): Write durability

    * MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures): Reliability indicator

    * NAND Type

## Two connection standards:

* SATA (M.2 SATA) → Same speed as a standard SATA SSD (up to ~560 MB/s)

* NVMe (PCIe connection) → Extremely fast. Around 3,500 MB/s with PCIe 3.0, and over 7,000 MB/s with PCIe 4.0



## Size

**Operating System alone** requires several GB to several dozen GB

    * Windows 11: needs 20GB or more just for installation

    * Lightweight Linux distros: anywhere from a few hundred MB to several GB

* **Applications** (browser, Office, games, etc.)

    * Each can take anywhere from hundreds of MB to several dozen GB

* **Games**

    * Modern titles typically require 50–150GB or more

* A single high-resolution photo (from a smartphone) can be around 2–5MB
