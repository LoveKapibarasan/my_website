## CPU

* Intel
**How to read the generation numbers (example: Intel Core ix-nnNNNZ)**
Core i3 / i5 / i7 / i9
nn = generation
NNN = The performance tier (the larger the number, the higher the tier).
The suffix letters (Z)
* K = Unlocked for overclocking
* F = No integrated GPU
* T = Low-power model
* H / HK / HS = High-performance laptop versions
* U = Low-power laptop version
* P = No integrated GPU (desktop, lower cost)
* E / P (new generations) = Hybrid CPU core type (Efficient / Performance)

* Ryzen(AMD)
**How to read the generation numbers (example: Ryzen N nnnZ)**

The first digit (N) → The generation (5000 series = Zen 3 architecture)

The following digits (nnn) → The performance tier (the larger the number, the higher the tier).

The suffix letters (Z)

* X = High clock / high performance version

* G = With integrated GPU
 
* U / H / HS = Laptop versions
    * multitask

* ARM

* IBM POWER -- for server


## OC Over Clock
* CPU e.g. 3.5GHz → 4.0GHz

* 1GHz = 10 billion work /1s .
* 9.13033 GHz
