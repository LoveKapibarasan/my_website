## Low-end (Entry-level)

Only the bare minimum of features

Limited expandability (fewer RAM slots, fewer USB ports, etc.)

Cheap (under ~$100)

## Mid-range

Balanced in price and features

Adequate expandability (e.g., 4 RAM slots, 2Ã— M.2 slots)

More than enough for gaming and general use

## High-end

Packed with features (PCIe 5.0, multi-GPU support, multiple M.2 slots, lots of USB ports, etc.)

Strong overclocking support

Robust power delivery (VRMs) to handle high-end CPUs and overclocking
