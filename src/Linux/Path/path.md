## Path 
* is the exact location of a file or folder in the filesystem, showing the hierarchy from the root directory to the item.

* It can be written as an **absolute** path (full location, e.g.,`C:\Users\Name\Documents\file.txt`) or a **relative** path (location relative to the current working directory).

* `.` = current dir
* `..` = go up
* `*`  = all
