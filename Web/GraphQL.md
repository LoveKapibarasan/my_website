# GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language used to work with APIs.

Itâ€™s often used as an alternative to REST APIs, and its key feature is that you can get exactly the data you need in a single request.

---

1. Schema
    A blueprint defined on the server that specifies which types of data can be fetched.
```graphql
query {
  user(id: 1) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}

```

2. Query
Used by the client to request only the fields it needs.

3. Mutation
Used when creating, updating, or deleting data.
```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(input: { name: "Taro", email: "taro@example.com" }) {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}

```
