## IP address
 = address in a network

## TCP = Transmission Control Protocol

* a communication protocol used on the internet to send data reliably between devices.
* Works together with IP ‚áí ‚ÄúTCP/IP‚Äù

## UDP =  User Datagram Protocol
Connectionless
```
Client ‚Üí Send packet ‚Üí Server
        (no handshake)
```
* No connection setup required
* Fire and forget

### IPV4 vs. IPV6
| Feature       | IPv4                           | IPv6                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Address size  | 32-bit (4 bytes)               | 128-bit (16 bytes)                              |
| Format        | Four numbers separated by dots | Eight groups of hex numbers separated by colons |
| Example       | `127.0.0.1`                    | `::1` / `2001:db8::1`                           |
| Address space | \~4.3 billion addresses        | virtually unlimited                             |

IPv4 is older and still used the most for example in a local network.
IPv6 is newer and solves the problem of running out of IPv4 addresses.




* `/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/` Setting dir.

```ini
[main]
dns=default

[ipv4]
ignore-auto-dns=true
dns=127.0.0.1;

[ipv6]
ignore-auto-dns=true
dns=::1;
```





## üìå iptables

* A firewall utility in Linux (part of the Netfilter framework).

* Purpose: control packet filtering, NAT, and routing rules.

* Works at the kernel level.

```bash
# Allow SSH (port 22)
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

# Block all incoming traffic by default
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
```




### WWW
www. = World Wide Web
* to distinguish web server from other server.
* Nowaday it has no meaning.


### WPSÔºàWi-Fi Protected SetupÔºâ
