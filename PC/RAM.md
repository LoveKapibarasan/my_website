## RAM (Random Access Memory) Standards (Generations)

RAM = 作業机

* DDR3: Older generation (mostly obsolete now)

* DDR4: The mainstream generation for PCs built between ~2014–2022

* DDR5: The latest generation (since 2021, most new custom PCs use DDR5).

## Form Factors (Size)

* DIMM: Full-size modules for desktops

* SO-DIMM: Smaller modules for laptops (not normally used in DIY desktops)

## Key Specs (Performance Metrics)

1. Capacity (GB)

8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB, etc.

2. Frequency (MHz / MT/s)

    * Memory clock speed (e.g., 3200MHz, 5600MHz)

    * DDR4 typically ~3200MHz

    * DDR5 ranges from 4800MHz up to 8000MHz+

3. Latency (CAS Latency / CL value)

    * Lower is faster


4. Channel Configuration (Single / Dual / Quad)

    * Dual-channel provides higher bandwidth than single, even with the same total capacity

    * Two-stick kits (dual-channel) are the norm in DIY PCs

### Voltage

    * DDR4: ~1.2V

    * DDR5: ~1.1V



## How to Choose (By Use Case)

* Basic office/light users: 8–16GB DDR4 is enough

* Gaming PCs: 16GB+, DDR4-3200 CL16 or DDR5-5600+

* Video editing/3D workstations: 32–64GB, ideally DDR5


## Swap

* Use SSD or HDD as virtual RAM.
