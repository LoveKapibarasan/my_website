* **Compile**  -- The specific process of translating human-readable source code 
* **Build**   -- The overall process of creating an executable or deployable program from source code. 
* **Download** -- The act of transferring files from a remote system (like the internet) to your local computer.
* **Install**  -- The process of placing a built (or downloaded) software package into the correct directories on a system so it can be used by the user or other programs.  
* **Port** -- Interface for application on a device.
* **Transpiler:**--A transpiler converts source code from one programming language to another language at a similar level of abstraction. For example, it translates TypeScript to JavaScript or Sass to CSS, maintaining comparable functionality in the target language.
* **Compiler:** -- A compiler translates high-level programming language code into low-level machine code or bytecode that can be directly executed by hardware or a virtual machine. This translation happens before runtime, producing an executable file or binary.
* **Interpreter:**
An interpreter directly executes source code line-by-line or statement-by-statement without prior translation to machine code. It reads, analyzes, and runs the program instructions in real-time during execution.
* **Binary**: Generated files by program.
* **Telemetry**: Correct user usage data
* **Macro**: 1. shortcut for repeat process.(Excel) 2. Big, Large
