## What is a socket?

* A CPU has a fixed shape for its "pins" or "contacts," and it can only be inserted into a motherboard socket that matches.


### AM4 or AM5
* If the CPU has pins on the bottom, it’s AM4.
* If the CPU has flat gold pads instead, it’s AM5


## BOX Version

* Retail package (boxed)

* Longer manufacturer warranty (for AMD: usually 3 years)

* Some models include a retail cooler (stock fan)

* Comes with a manual, stickers, and other extras

## Tray / Bulk Version

* Form used for large-scale shipments by the manufacturer
→ Called “Tray” because CPUs are shipped in bulk, lined up in trays for OEMs and shops

* Shorter warranty / often shop warranty only (about 6–12 months)

* No cooler or box included — only the CPU itself

* Therefore, slightly cheaper in price


### Architecture


* AMD


**How to read the generation numbers ( Ryzen N nnnnZ)**

The first digit (N) → The generation

The following digits (nnnn) → The performance tier. It refers to generation.

The suffix letters (Z)

* X = High clock / high performance version

* G = With integrated GPU
 
* U / H / HS = Laptop versions

* All model can do over clocking.

### Bulldozer
* FX

### Zen

* AM4
