## 1. Light programming (web development, Python scripts, small-scale C/C++ compilation, etc.)

* Mainly relies on single-core performance.

* Geekbench single-core score of 1200 or higher.

## 2. Medium-scale development (Android/iOS app development, code with parallel processing, multitasking)

* Multi-core performance also becomes important.

* Target Geekbench multi-core score: 6000–10000.

# 3. Large-scale projects/builds (Chromium, Unreal Engine, Linux kernel, etc.)

* Compilation uses the CPU to its fullest → core count and cache are critical.

* Recommended Geekbench multi-core score: 12000 or higher.
